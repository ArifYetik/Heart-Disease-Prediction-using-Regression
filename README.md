# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Regression

In this study we used R program with some packages. Research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using regression models. We will use our data to create a model which tries to predict if a patient has this disease or not.

Cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases are a global threat. Due to such high deaths, there is a need to tackle the reasons behind these diseases. Most Coronary Heart Diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors. It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counseling and medicines can begin. Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence and softwares have led to the emergence of expert systems for medical applications. Moreover, in the last few decades computational tools have been designed to improve the experiences and abilities of expertss for making decisions about their patients.

In this study we used R program with some packages. Research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using regression models. We will use our data to create a model which tries to predict if a patient has this disease or not.

The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
